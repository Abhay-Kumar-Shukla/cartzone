# Cartzone

Microsoft Engage 2022 : Three problem statements were given out of which making an application by using facial reorganization was more  appeasing  to me so I chose to make “CartZone” an application which recommends products according to facial attributes of user ,and to get personalized service as per their requirement and their interests from first visit only. I am still working for the improvement and better working of the application.
